This project was assembled using MPASM. All I/O logic is active-low.
The program controls a 7-segment LED using only 4 inputs to the microcontroller.

Pin Configuration:

	PORTA.4 - MSB
	.
	.
	PORTA.0 - LSB

	PORTB.6 - Segment A
	PORTB.5 - Segment B
	PORTB.4 - Segment C
	PORTB.3 - Segment D
	PORTB.2 - Segment E
	PORTB.1 - Segment F
	PORTB.0 - Segment G
